# Space-Commander
A endurance shooter game in Game Maker.

## Premise
This was my primary work in-between academic Game Maker projects. This game originally had an upper score limit transition into the bosses, but decided to make it an endurance game.

## Usage
The requirements for this program are the same as Game Maker 8.1. Arrow keys move the ship, spacebar to fire. Ctrl to switch weapons (the smaller ones have less coverage but reward a higher score per hit). You can hold the fire button down to charge your weapon. Alternatively, you can press B to throw out a bomb, which can be volleyed via lasers. Pressing S for shield is invincible, but you have a limited amount of them, make it count!
